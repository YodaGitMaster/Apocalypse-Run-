# Project State

## Current Status: Power Management System Complete ✅

### Last Completed Action
- **COMPLETE BATTERY DRAIN FIX**: Eliminated ALL sources of battery drain when flashlight is OFF
- **Final Bug**: Game initialization was setting PowerManager consumption to Level 1 rate regardless of flashlight on/off state
- **Initialization Bug**: `updateFlashlightConsumption('flashlight', flashlight.getCurrentLevel())` ignored that flashlight starts OFF
- **Complete Solution Chain**:
  1. **Initialization**: Check `isFlashlightOn()` during setup → Set consumption to 0 if OFF, level rate if ON
  2. **Toggle OFF**: `onLevelChange(0)` → PowerManager sets rate to 0
  3. **Level Changes While OFF**: PowerManager NOT notified → Rate stays 0  
  4. **Toggle ON**: `onLevelChange(currentLevel)` → PowerManager sets correct rate
- **Result**: Battery NEVER drains when flashlight is OFF, from game start through all interactions

### Active Components
- **MazeGenerator**: Creates 30x30 maze with exit point selection
- **PlayerController**: FPS movement with smooth lag (0.024 factor)
- **LootboxManager**: Spawns and manages collectible lootboxes with points
- **PowerManager**: Manages electricity consumption and lighting effects
- **AudioManager**: Handles atmospheric music and procedural sound effects
- **DebugManager**: Provides bird's eye view and maze analysis tools
- **Game**: Orchestrates maze generation, spawning, and game over logic
- **Three.js Scene**: Renders maze with power-managed lighting

### Current Features
- **Maze Generation**: Random maze on each reload with exit point
- **Room System**: 4-8 unit rooms with corridor connections  
- **Movement**: Smooth laggy controls (forward 1.5, backward 0.45 speed)
- **Camera**: 30° pitch, 60° yaw limits with smooth lag
- **Body Rotation**: A/D continuous rotation at same lag speed
- **Direction Arrow**: Red arrow showing walking direction
- **Exit System**: Blue light at spawn, red light at exit (farthest 25% from spawn)
- **Lootbox System**: 10-15 collectible lootboxes with 4 rarity tiers (10-100 pts)
- **Power Management**: All lights consume electricity, lootboxes provide charges
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Dimming/flickering effects based on power level
- **Audio System**: Horror atmosphere with dynamic music and procedural SFX
- **Debug Mode**: Bird's eye view with full lighting and visual markers (` key toggle)
- **Point Scoring**: Real-time HUD display with power and collection stats
- **Game Over**: Automatic detection with final score and restart functionality

### Next Required Steps
1. Add physics colliders for maze walls
2. Update physics world for maze collision
3. Test maze navigation and collision

### Blockers
None - lootbox system working correctly

### Technical Notes
- Maze size: 30x30 cells (2x2 units each)
- Wall height: 3 units
- Room generation: 15 attempts, 4-8 unit sizes
- Spawn: Random position in rooms or corridors
- Lootbox spawn: 4-8 per maze, guaranteed 1 in start room, 3x3 grid distribution
- Lootbox spacing: 15+ units apart (3-minute walking distance), 1.5+ from spawn, 3+ from exit
- Rarity distribution: Common 50%, Rare 30%, Epic 15%, Legendary 5%
- Power system: 6000 initial units, much larger battery capacity
- Flashlight consumption: L1=10/s (6min), L2=15/s (4min), L3=30/s (2min), L4=60/s (1min), L5=120/s (30s)
- Charge values: Common 180, Rare 360, Epic 720, Legendary 1080 units
