# Project State

## Current Status: Exit Point System Complete ✅

### Last Completed Action
- Added exit point selection system with distance-based algorithm
- Implemented blue start light and red exit light with pulsing effects
- Added game over detection when player reaches exit
- Created game over screen with restart functionality

### Active Components
- **MazeGenerator**: Creates 30x30 maze with exit point selection
- **PlayerController**: FPS movement with smooth lag (0.024 factor)
- **Game**: Orchestrates maze generation, spawning, and game over logic
- **Three.js Scene**: Renders maze with lighting and special lights

### Current Features
- **Maze Generation**: Random maze on each reload with exit point
- **Room System**: 4-8 unit rooms with corridor connections  
- **Movement**: Smooth laggy controls (forward 1.5, backward 0.45 speed)
- **Camera**: 30° pitch, 60° yaw limits with smooth lag
- **Body Rotation**: A/D continuous rotation at same lag speed
- **Direction Arrow**: Red arrow showing walking direction
- **Exit System**: Blue light at spawn, red light at exit (farthest 25% from spawn)
- **Game Over**: Automatic detection and restart functionality

### Next Required Steps
1. Add physics colliders for maze walls
2. Update physics world for maze collision
3. Test maze navigation and collision

### Blockers
None - exit point system working correctly

### Technical Notes
- Maze size: 30x30 cells (2x2 units each)
- Wall height: 3 units
- Room generation: 15 attempts, 4-8 unit sizes
- Spawn: Random position in rooms or corridors
