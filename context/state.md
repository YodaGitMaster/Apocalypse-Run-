# Project State

## Current Status: Power Management System Complete ✅

### Last Completed Action
- **COMPREHENSIVE LOOTBOX & NAVIGATION SYSTEM OVERHAUL**: Implemented all requested improvements
- **Rarity Limits & Guarantees**:
  - **Legendary**: Exactly 1 per game (guaranteed with fallback system)
  - **Epic**: Exactly 1 per game (guaranteed in last 4 positions if not placed)
  - **Rare**: Maximum 2 per game (guaranteed at least 1 in last 3 positions if none placed)
  - **Common**: All remaining boxes (guaranteed to exist)
- **Navigation System Improvements**:
  - **Duration**: Increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds (1 minute)
  - **Strategic Placement**: Navigation boxes now spawn 8-20 units near legendary boxes
  - **Smart Targeting**: Prioritizes legendary proximity over random placement
- **Result**: All box types guaranteed every game with strategic navigation aid near the most valuable rewards

### Active Components
- **MazeGenerator**: Creates 30x30 maze with exit point selection
- **PlayerController**: FPS movement with smooth lag (0.024 factor)
- **LootboxManager**: Spawns and manages collectible lootboxes with points
- **PowerManager**: Manages electricity consumption and lighting effects
- **AudioManager**: Handles atmospheric music and procedural sound effects
- **DebugManager**: Provides bird's eye view and maze analysis tools
- **Game**: Orchestrates maze generation, spawning, and game over logic
- **Three.js Scene**: Renders maze with power-managed lighting

### Current Features
- **Maze Generation**: Random maze on each reload with exit point
- **Room System**: 4-8 unit rooms with corridor connections  
- **Movement**: Smooth laggy controls (forward 1.5, backward 0.45 speed)
- **Camera**: 30° pitch, 60° yaw limits with smooth lag
- **Body Rotation**: A/D continuous rotation at same lag speed
- **Direction Arrow**: Red arrow showing walking direction
- **Exit System**: Blue light at spawn, red light at exit (farthest 25% from spawn)
- **Lootbox System**: 10-15 collectible lootboxes with 4 rarity tiers (10-100 pts)
- **Power Management**: All lights consume electricity, lootboxes provide charges
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Dimming/flickering effects based on power level
- **Audio System**: Horror atmosphere with dynamic music and procedural SFX
- **Debug Mode**: Bird's eye view with full lighting and visual markers (` key toggle)
- **Point Scoring**: Real-time HUD display with power and collection stats
- **Game Over**: Automatic detection with final score and restart functionality

### Next Required Steps
1. Add physics colliders for maze walls
2. Update physics world for maze collision
3. Test maze navigation and collision

### Blockers
None - lootbox system working correctly

### Technical Notes
- Maze size: 30x30 cells (2x2 units each)
- Wall height: 3 units
- Room generation: 15 attempts, 4-8 unit sizes
- Spawn: Random position in rooms or corridors
- Lootbox spawn: 4-8 per maze, guaranteed 1 in start room, 3x3 grid distribution
- Lootbox spacing: 15+ units apart (3-minute walking distance), 1.5+ from spawn, 3+ from exit
- Rarity distribution: Common 50%, Rare 30%, Epic 15%, Legendary 5%
- Power system: 6000 initial units, much larger battery capacity
- Flashlight consumption: L1=10/s (6min), L2=15/s (4min), L3=30/s (2min), L4=60/s (1min), L5=120/s (30s)
- Charge values: Common 180, Rare 360, Epic 720, Legendary 1080 units
