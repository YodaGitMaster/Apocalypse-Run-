# Project State - Quake Arena WebGPU Game

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-21 Foundation Complete

## Current Status
- **Active Task**: FPS Movement System Complete
- **Last Action**: Implemented proper ground collision and natural camera constraints
- **Next Step**: Test improved movement, then add maze generation

## Project Overview
Building browser-based Quake Arena clone using:
- WebGPU for rendering (migrating from existing WebGL2)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Rapier for physics
- ECS architecture for game systems
- WebRTC for networking

## Existing Assets
- `index.html`: Complete WebGL2 FPS prototype with:
  - Basic 3D rendering, camera controls
  - WASD movement, mouse look, jumping
  - Simple arena geometry
  - Performance stats display

## Architecture Target
```
/src
  main.ts           # boot, game loop
  gpu.ts            # device/context, pipelines, buffers  
  shaders/standard.wgsl
  math/mat4.ts, vec3.ts
  input.ts          # keys, pointer lock, bindings
  camera.ts         # FPS camera & feel
  physics/world.ts  # rapier setup, queries
  ecs/world.ts, systems/, components/
  gameplay/weapons.ts, projectiles.ts, pickups.ts
  net/client.ts, messages.ts
assets/maps/, textures/, sounds/
```

## Completed Foundation
✅ TypeScript project with Vite build system  
✅ Three.js WebGL2 renderer with shadows
✅ Rapier3D physics integration (WASM resolved)
✅ bitecs ECS architecture foundation
✅ **Proper FPS movement system**:
  - Ground collision and gravity
  - Natural camera pitch constraints (±60°)
  - Physics-based player controller
  - Smooth WASD movement on ground plane
✅ Input handling with pointer lock
✅ Basic 3D scene with lighting and materials

## Next Priorities
1. Physics integration with Rapier
2. ECS architecture for game objects
3. Weapon systems and projectiles
4. Map loading system
5. Networking foundation
