# Project State

## Current Status: Maze Generation Complete ✅

### Last Completed Action
- Created comprehensive maze generator with rooms and corridors
- Integrated maze generation into Three.js scene
- Added random spawn positioning in maze
- Configured lighting for maze environment

### Active Components
- **MazeGenerator**: Creates 30x30 maze with rooms and tunnels
- **PlayerController**: FPS movement with smooth lag (0.024 factor)
- **Game**: Orchestrates maze generation and player spawning
- **Three.js Scene**: Renders maze with optimized lighting

### Current Features
- **Maze Generation**: Random maze on each reload
- **Room System**: 4-8 unit rooms with corridor connections  
- **Movement**: Smooth laggy controls (forward 1.5, backward 0.45 speed)
- **Camera**: 30° pitch, 60° yaw limits with smooth lag
- **Body Rotation**: A/D continuous rotation at same lag speed
- **Direction Arrow**: Red arrow showing walking direction

### Next Required Steps
1. Add physics colliders for maze walls
2. Update physics world for maze collision
3. Test maze navigation and collision

### Blockers
None - maze generation working correctly

### Technical Notes
- Maze size: 30x30 cells (2x2 units each)
- Wall height: 3 units
- Room generation: 15 attempts, 4-8 unit sizes
- Spawn: Random position in rooms or corridors
