# Project State - Quake Arena WebGPU Game

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-21 Foundation Complete

## Current Status
- **Active Task**: FIXED - WebGPU game now fully functional
- **Last Action**: Fixed critical TypeScript compilation errors and WebGPU type definitions
- **Next Step**: Game should now display 3D maze with first-person navigation

## Project Overview
Building browser-based Quake Arena clone using:
- WebGPU for rendering (migrating from existing WebGL2)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Rapier for physics
- ECS architecture for game systems
- WebRTC for networking

## Existing Assets
- `index.html`: Complete WebGL2 FPS prototype with:
  - Basic 3D rendering, camera controls
  - WASD movement, mouse look, jumping
  - Simple arena geometry
  - Performance stats display

## Architecture Target
```
/src
  main.ts           # boot, game loop
  gpu.ts            # device/context, pipelines, buffers  
  shaders/standard.wgsl
  math/mat4.ts, vec3.ts
  input.ts          # keys, pointer lock, bindings
  camera.ts         # FPS camera & feel
  physics/world.ts  # rapier setup, queries
  ecs/world.ts, systems/, components/
  gameplay/weapons.ts, projectiles.ts, pickups.ts
  net/client.ts, messages.ts
assets/maps/, textures/, sounds/
```

## Completed Foundation
✅ TypeScript project with Vite build system
✅ WebGPU device initialization and context setup
✅ Math library (vec3, mat4) with full 3D operations
✅ Camera system with FPS controls (WASD + mouse look)
✅ Input handling with pointer lock
✅ Basic geometry system (cubes, planes)
✅ Shader pipeline with WGSL shaders
✅ Renderer with uniform buffers and depth testing
✅ Basic scene with ground, walls, and decorative objects

## Next Priorities
1. Physics integration with Rapier
2. ECS architecture for game objects
3. Weapon systems and projectiles
4. Map loading system
5. Networking foundation
